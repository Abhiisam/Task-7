Q:1 write a python program using function to which will do the following 
a.) the function will create a text file with the current timestamp.
b.)the file content should have the content of the current timestamp.

import datetime

def create_timestamp_file_with_content():
    current_time = datetime.datetime.now()
    formatted_time = current_time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")  # Format the timestamp

    file_name = f"timestamp_content_{formatted_time}.txt"  # Create a file name with timestamp

    try:
        with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
            file.write(f"This file was created at: {formatted_time}")
        print(f"File '{file_name}' created successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error creating file: {str(e)}")

# Call the function to create the file
create_timestamp_file_with_content()

Q:2 write another python function to read from a text file. the function will take the name of the text file and display the content of the file into the console

def read_text_file(file_name):
    try:
        with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
            print(f"Content of '{file_name}':\n{content}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File '{file_name}' not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading file: {str(e)}")

# Example usage: replace 'file_name.txt' with your actual file name
file_name = 'your_file_name.txt'
read_text_file(file_name)
